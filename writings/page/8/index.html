          <p>Marking up and styling forms in HTML and CSS is something you either love or hate. Personally I love it, since it's one of these things I can be really nitty-picky with – to iterate and iterate over the appearance and behavior of the form. "Is this simple enough? Is this section necessary? Should we separate this from that?", and so on.</p>

          <p>Peter Michaux on Javascript: > One of the most obvious deficiencies in JavaScript is with its user interface: its syntax. The inability to quickly improve its syntax has lead to the language’s downfall.
If you have to read a single article on Javascript this month; make it this one. Insightful, nitty-gritty computer science-y stuff is promised (don't worry about the overly dramatic title). Lots of great musings, code samples, history, and suggestions on improvements of Javascript, and also about the state of compilers such as CoffeeScript. > Since CoffeeScript compilers are in the hands of developers rather than the visitors to sites, you control which version of CoffeeScript you are using. You can upgrade at will. This also means CoffeeScript does not need to be standardized and go through the subsequent painfully slow growth of a standardized language. CoffeeScript can grow at the rate of its community’s imagination and desire. JavaScript standardization was essential to the success of the web but the same constraints do not apply to CoffeeScript.
(I also recommend checking out more of Peter's articles. Some really good stuff in there).</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Documenting code is important, and I think Zach successfully explains why and how in his post. I often find documenting code quite tricky, since it forces you to make it really clear and concise. It challenges you to write good code, since another guy is supposed to understand how everything works from reading the docs. "Can I scrap this method? Do I have to refactor? Is this too tightly coupled?". When you're documenting, you might see the obvious flaws in the code flow, and it's a win-win.</p>

          <p>CSS Transforms, Transitions and Animations are great and all, but apparently they are causing issues with some text on a page. I've experienced those issues on my site, and I couldn't for my life figure out what the problem was. Some text paragraphs could suddenly lose their antialiasing, and look very jagged and, yeah, aliased. They would yet get antialiasing again when I scrolled the page up and down, or resized the browser window. Weirdness. Follow the link above for a post on the Posterous blog about the issue. Apparently, WebKit's 3D Transforms were the culprits, since it gives the relevant elements hardware acceleration, and ...</p>

          <p>In Responsive Web Design we’re working with different states, widths, and viewport sizes. Fluidity and adaptive behavior is a hot subject nowadays, and it’s perfectly justified when looking at today’s mobile browser landscape. We achieve this with CSS’s Media Queries. But sometimes it can be messy – I’m gonna share a quick tip for indicating (with pure CSS) which media query that has actually kicked in.</p>
