          <p>Gridset is a tool for making grids. It lets you create whatever type of grid you want: columnar, asymmetrical, ratio, compound, fixed, fluid, responsive and more. It serves multiple grids to your site based on breakpoints for different devices.
I'm so excited for this app that I had to post it here. From Mark Boulton et al., what could go wrong? (which is the case with grid generators).</p>

          <p>In school, we recently finished a project in the GUI design course, where we (a group of four people) built an application for grocery shopping, aimed towards elderly people. The tools were quite horrible: Java, Swing, Netbeans, and the currently deprecated Swing Application Framework. In two weeks, a working prototype had to be finished, and for freshmen who just had taken an autumn of two introductory courses in Java, it seemed a bit harsh. After all, the course is about "GUI design" – that doesn't ring very well together with "Java" and "Swing".</p>

          <p>Props to the people who worked hard on Java frameworks who make tons of people happy in the heavy infrastructure enterprise realm, props to the people behind PHP and associated frameworks, props to Rails dev for pushing the envelope and making me enjoy programming again and props to Ryan Dahl, Google and Joyent for making Node happen and shaking the bottle once again.
The perfect framework or language will never be created, and that's why this industry is so exhilarating and fun to watch and be a part of.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>I recently wiped my Macbook Pro's hard drive and installed OS X Lion. It was nice with a clean, fresh start again, and I had for a couple of weeks looked forward to set up my dev environment from the ground up (nerd alert). Ever since I got my Mac, things had been piling up, and it felt very fragile. So this time I did everything right. During my journeys through the internets I picked up nifty tools and techniques, as well as other blog posts describing pitfalls and other general tips. Google around for something like _"setting up web development environment os x". _Two gems are Setting Up a Ruby Development Machine From Scratch With OS X Lion and Setting Up an Apple Mac for Ruby Development (just skip the parts about RVM, I'll get to that further down). I also made a list of every technology/tool/language I needed: Johan's Checklist They are ordered by importance and dependency.</p>
