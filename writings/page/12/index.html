        <div class="post-text">
          <p>What does Google have to gain from dropping H.264? Nothing at face value; it’s all to do with preventing H.264 from becoming the de facto standard for “Video on the Web”, not realizing that it already is. Perhaps Google made this move to try and dethrone H.264, but to that end, I have but one question: Why do it in a way that hurts your users when time itself would sort that out automatically?
Faruk Ateş' great write-up on the situation with Google's rejection of the H.264 codec in Chrome. It's one thing to invent a new codec or format, put it in your browser and lobby for other vendors and manufacturers to support it. But Google has completely shut off any chance for H.264 to be a really great standard for video on the internet. The author put it: "Time will take care of this itself", which is quite obvious. VHS took care of Betamax, Blueray took care of HD-DVD. > If that’s really why they did it, and that’s all it is, then harming users in the process is a poor decision in my opinion. Especially since that very same goal could have been accomplished with just a little waiting.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>The syntax for CSS3 Gradients has in Webkit been something of a pain, frankly. I prefer Gecko's more straight-forward version, but since I'm using Sass with its mixins, it's not a huge deal. In a blog post posted today, the Webkit team describes a new simpler gradient syntax. The old one dealt with percent values, it wasn't very liberal with the order of the arguments, and so on. Here's an example of the new syntax for a linear gradient:</p>

          <p>Every person’s sleeping habits are different. You’ve heard about morning persons and evening persons, and some of that comes from the genes, I’d guess, and maybe some from practice. I remember in school how some people were just sleep-walking zombies in the morning – it was sometimes totally impossible for them to get up for the early classes. Other guys and girls couldn’t stay up too late in the evening since they were completely out of energy (aka. “party poopers”).</p>

          <p>When you've created themes for Wordpress for a while, you're starting to feel that you're doing the same thing over and over again (which you technically are). Since many Wordpress sites got features you can and should reuse it would be awesome with a great boilerplate theme, wouldn't it? A stripped, starting-off theme with all the essentials.</p>

          <p>Really great article on the state of RSS. I've seen many posts claiming "RSS is dead", but to me it's absolutely not dead – the technology is everywhere on the web! It's built in inside every major blog system, CMS, web framework and web app. That's not a dead technology. The problem is, as the article puts it, that RSS hasn't received the widespread user base it deserves. It's being ignored, and failed by browser vendors and others.</p>

          <p>Kod app is a promising code editor for OS X, created by the Swede (wohoo!) Rasmus Andersson. A bunch of features are promised, and the big news is that Rasmus today announced the project  open sourced at Github. Great stuff. There's also a beta out if you want to try it out. I think it's awesome with a new simple, light-weight editor that's actually maintained. If Kod gets versatile, flexible, great features and highly customizable, I think we've got a player.</p>
