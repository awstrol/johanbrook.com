**This page** reflects what I'm doing with my life at the moment. No pressure here, Johanâ€¦

I have the privilege of traveling while working remotely (doing this nomad thing). My current travel plans are:

1. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ **Madrid**, Spain (January)
2. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¾ **AsunciÃ³n**, Paraguay (February-April, *if El NiÃ±o doesn't fuck the country over again*)
3. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· **Rio de Janeiro**, Brazil (early April)
4. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **Marseilles**, France (rest of April)
5. *?*
6. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª **Gothenburg**, Sweden (early June)
7. *?*

I spend my time on these things:

- working in [Lookback](http://lookback.io) as web app developer and designer. Mostly doing product and writing Javascript in [Meteor](http://meteor.com).
- reading books and articles, in order to get my mind off the digital things. Ironically, I mostly read articles on product design, code, and startups.
- meeting new people in the cities I visit, as well as connecting with existing ones.
- trying to come up with a nice side project. I think I'm on to something, and it involves [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org).
- photo snapping and travel memories collecting on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/johanbrook/).
- learning Spanish on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/johanbrook).
- writing [open source packages for Meteor](https://atmospherejs.com/lookback/).
- trying to write more articles on this site.

If my life changes, I'll update this page.
