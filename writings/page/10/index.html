            <h1><a href="/writings/customizing-the-wordpress-admin-bar">Customizing the Wordpress Admin Bar</a></h1>
        </header>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Wordpress 3.1 brought us a lot of things; an admin bar amongst others. That one's been present on hosted Wordpress.com blogs for quite some time, and available as a plugin as well. At first I deactivated the bar at once, but later I realized it's pretty handy to have around. I usually make my own admin menus for quick access to stats, new posts and more, but the official admin bar is more versatile (I'm using the Wordpress function current_user_can("manage_options") in an if-statement to show the admin menu only to me).  Anyway, how about customizing the admin bar? You know: add stuff, style stuff. Plugins and themes may add their own menus to the bar, as with the Wordpress.com Stats plugin I'm using, for instance. A small graph is shown in the bar if you've got the plugin installed, with a link to the admin stats page. Neat – as you see on the screenshot above it also shows the shortlink to the current page/post. The rendering of the bar itself builds upon a simple API you can hook into, but I haven't found any documentation in the Wordpress Codex yet though, so I'm gonna show some simple examples from what I've picked up from the Wordpress core. First we need a hook. The Wordpress developers advise us to use admin_bar_menu . Right on. Add this to functions.php :</p>

            <h1><a href="/writings/take-a-step-back">Take a step back</a></h1>
        </header>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>A while ago I was visiting a relative/client regarding some counseling about her brand new Wordpress site. While being there she mentioned some flyers she and her husband had made for the business (garden services). Since spring is coming along you've got to ramp up quickly now because of the huge demand later on, therefore the need for a flyer just to "get it out there". I have to say I had loved to design it myself – no doubt – but then I saw the flyer they had created. I really liked it and was impressed. It was an elegant gallery of garden photos on portrait piece of paper, with the logotype in the middle. I think it was 3x6 small photos ordered in a grid. To be honest, I couldn't have made it better myself. I believe the moral of the story is that everybody can design. It just has to be simple enough. If I was to design that flyer, I had started to decide on typography, grids, hierarchy, colour scheme, what kind of photos to use, etc. I had given it too much thought and bypassed the really simple, straight-forward and plain beautiful solution. It's important to take a step back as a designer (and developer as well) and think of what you're doing. Is it really crucial and vital that the text lines up perfectly to the horizontal grid? Is it worth it to rewrite a large part of the application just to make use of that cool library? "Regular" people (if I may say so) aren't always dumb users who have no idea of what they want. When I was young and foolish I used to be so very eager to build stuff that I didn't care too much about asking people (and myself) what really mattered the most with this application/design. I ended up feeling like I had missed something. Of course there are boundaries where you actually shouldn't consult end-users, focus groups and so on. But what I mean is that it's quite good to step away from the designer/developer role and get back to the roots sometimes. Everybody will gain from it.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Wordpress has quite many nifty features, the vast library of template tags is one of them. One thing I've missed for a long time is a quick function to link to internal pages. Since the root URL will change if you switch domains you could absolutely not code the absolute URL by hand. You can't rely on the permalink structure you've set up on your local installation either (which means creating root relative links like <a href="/some-page">Some page</a> is a bad idea).</p>

          <p>Sometimes while browsing the web in Mobile Safari you might find yourself wanting to view the current site in your desktop browser. We all know it's tedious, boring and plain wrong to type in the URL from the Mobile Safari window into the desktop browser's address field, so of course someone has come up with a solution for this. Well, many solutions. I hear from other people that Tapbots' Pastebot works great, but this means you've got to go through a third party app. Not everybody want that. So of course there's a quick, hacky and dirty solution to the problem, which uses nothing but native OS X/iOS technologies and the amazing Dropbox as always (as well as a free web service). Check out the link above for the complete guide. In short: connect your Dropbox to the free Send to Dropbox service which lets you e-mail stuff to your Dropbox account (in this case the web page URL as a text file), and set up a Automator folder action which runs a Ruby script that opens the text file and put the URL in your browser window.</p>
