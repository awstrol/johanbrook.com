        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Backups are important. Really, really important. They say if you don’t have two or more copies of a file, the file doesn’t exist. I had no backups whatsoever until a couple of weeks ago, when I thought to myself: “What would I do if my hard drive breaks? Would I do well losing years and years of work?”. Of course not! I really had to start securing and backing up my data, and what follows is a quick writeup on the process.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>You know how it is with redesigns – they’re like drugs to a designer. Some last longer than others, but soon enough you'll need your fix. My site is always in constant redesign mode, with a goal to not have to make another redesign. Actually when it comes to site redesigns, I think it’s quite incorrect to call it a redesign. Quite blurry, to be honest. To realign the elements sounds better to me – to take a look at the old site and ask yourself: “What’s working in this design, and what’s not?”. It’s a constant iteration thing, and I’ve tried to bring the elements and concepts I liked the most from the old design into this one.</p>

        </header>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Spotify is a revolutionary service which has done most things right. A great native, desktop application and a companion iPhone/Android/other smartphones app makes it the most tasteful music streaming service from my point of view. It's been quite controversial offering users free and unlimited streaming of almost all music in the world, if you were willing to put up with a few ads. Up until now. One of the co-founders, Daniel Ek, posted on the Spotify blog that the Free and Open options will see some changes effective May 1st. These changes doesn't affect new users – the ones who has set up their accounts on or after November 1st – for another six months. Free or Open accounts created before November 1st will be able to play each track in the catalogue for free up to 5 times, and the total listening time per month will be 10 hours. Sounds shocking in the sense that Spotify has always been completely free with the Free options since it launched, but I completely understand and encourage Spotify's decision. They need income, as every other company. Sure, you get lots of goodwill and good karma from regular people who just wants to listen to music for free, but where's the profit in that? Ads can't pay everything. They're still keeping the Free option, of course, but a little bit stripped down to lead people into the Unlimited or Premium options. Seriously: 50-100 SEK per month isn't a big deal for unlimited music. Today's news certainly pushed me to upgrade.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Not too long after the original iPad was announced, the device was predicted to be the savior of magazines. Made by Apple, at least it wasn't going to be a (huge) flop. A couple of months into the raging campaign of the iPad vs. the rest of the (newly assembled) tablet manufacturer crowd, it's clear that the former is a hit. But what about magazines? There's been quite a boom on the digital magazine front – large and small publishers have pushed issues out on the App Store, or via publishing platforms like Qiozk, Paperton and Mag+. But there hasn't been any "Wow"-effect. Many of the magazines consists of static images (!) made "interactive" with flashy animations and layer effects.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>After a complete rewrite during the weekend, my barebones starter theme for Wordpress is up at GitHub. It provides a basic HTML5 structure with partials, lots of handy helper functions, and a couple of setup configurations. Check out the ReadMe and try it out. It evolved from my own habits when creating Wordpress sites, so the GitHub repo also serves as a great location to store the files and access them from anywhere. It's only a skeleton, so no styling is included (check out my Sass framework for that). Frequently used Javascript libraries are included though, as well as a suggestion on a .htaccess file.</p>

          <p>Rasmus Andersson on the latest release of the Firefox browser: > Although Firefox 4 is a clear improvement over the previous version, it’s not the ultimate sports car you’ve been dreaming about taking to the streets.
Firefox was the knight in shining armor, fighting Internet Explorer bravely. We've got a lot to thank Firefox, but today it almost seems like itself is the new IE. Sluggish, non-native, and not up to date with the latest web technologies is not attractive. Sort of like that weird, anti-social cousin you have to invite to the party. Rasmus further talks about some UI/UX features and drawbacks. I've tested the beta, but when I installed the stable version there was this "meh" moment. I don't hate Firefox, but I don't love it either. It's great for development – Firebug is superior to the WebKit Inspector sometimes – but the whole application just seems so awkward and non-native. I've moved to Chrome from Safari, and I love Chrome's minimal approach and its snappiness – things Firefox lacks. Funny how Mozilla fails to get back in the game when they clearly see how Chrome gains market share, and Safari rambles on with full throttle. But since Firefox 5 most likely will arrive this summer, and Firefox 6 isn't that far behind, Mozilla shows that they're focused on more rapid iterations. Rasmus shows us a lot of things Mozilla still got wrong in Firefox. It's a depressive list, to be honest.</p>
