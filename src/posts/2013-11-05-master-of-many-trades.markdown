> We hear the descriptive words psychopath and sociopath all the time, but here’s a new one: monopath. It means a person with a narrow mind, a one-track brain, a bore, a super-specialist, an expert with no other interests — in other words, the role-model of choice in the Western world.
Great text about things I've written or linked to before: how being wide in your interests and learning really is a great way of living. Personally, I am able to connect things that I previously thought were separate, building bridges between areas, and seeing things in a larger perspective, giving me a deeper understanding of the subject and thus a unique satisfaction with what I am currently doing. People often say you have to put in 10 000 hours in a subject in order to ultimately master it. Is it worth it? Perhaps. If your fire burns for a single track, go for it. I prefer to stimulate my mind with impressions from a larger set of areas.
