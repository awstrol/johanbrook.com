        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Quite a few people use this style of quick links or short posts (myself included). Daring Fireball, Shawn Blanc and others. When linking to an article of site, the post heading itself becomes the link. It's quite good usability and UX, and is not that hard to re-create in Wordpress.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Some thorough work by Nathan Smith (creator of the 960 grid system) with the goal to remove inconsistencies between browsers and platforms. > I want some measure of control over form elements, without changing them so drastically as to appear foreign in a user’s operating system. Thus, my quest to find a happy medium, where browsers would generally agree and let me keep my sanity. The result is what I’m simply referring to as  Formalize CSS.
It's some really good work he's done there, and I'll for sure take a closer look.</p>

          <p>Eric Butler has written a Firefox extension which sniffs all connections made to insecure websites inside your current WiFi area. You can even double click on the identities in the sidebar and log in as them. Totally freaky. > HTTP session hijacking (sometimes called "sidejacking") is when an attacker gets a hold of a user's cookie, allowing them to do anything the user can do on a particular website. On an open wireless network, cookies are basically shouted through the air, making these attacks extremely easy. This is a widely known problem that has been talked about to death, yet very popular websites continue to fail at protecting their users. The only effective fix for this problem is full end-to-end encryption, known on the web as HTTPS or SSL.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>This is great: newly released Windows Phone 7 in some cases needs you to manually fill in an activation code in order to hook the phone up with your Windows Live account. The problem is you're supposed to receive the code from Microsoft's support, which in the UK isn't working on weekends. Nice one.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Cabel Sasser from Panic posted about Panic's future doings. I was most pleased about their mention of Coda 2, which they're working hard on: "For the most part, though, it’s all hands on the next Coda. That’s what we’re living and breathing. Awesomeness. I think the next major release of my daily code editor will be really great. He also brought up the upcoming 1.7 release of Coda. Extended support for HTML5 dictionaries and Javascript events, and more CSS goodness. Update, October 26th 2011: Again, Sasser has posted on the Panic Blog about Coda 2. Panic has apparently been working with the application for 1,5 years, and has now initiated the private beta tests to hammer out some bugs. The beta signup form is now closed, but there were 4 000 signups all together (!).</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Hi and welcome to my new personal site. I've finally been able to get out of the six months long swamp known as "creative block", "problems deciding" and "lack of time". I'm a boy man of perfection and innovation and we all know that we are our own's worst client. This new site features a journal (with posts and quickies), a work sample page, an about page with services and contact info. The previous designs were quite ambitious, and were sort of "too big" for me. It took a couple of iterations for me to realize that I didn't need an XXL site. Just a place for writing, showing off my work and contact info would be fine. I'm quite embarrassed sitting here in October with  a site I planned to launch in March, but I've learnt a lot during the process.</p>
