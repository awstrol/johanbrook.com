        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Twitter clients come and go, but this one had me at "Helvetica". Trickle is a client which doesn't have all features you're used to. Tweets from your timeline is "trickling" in white Helvetica on the dark screen from the right while the device quietly sits on your desk (preferably in a dock). It does three things: shows tweets, retweets and favorites. Very simple. No profiles, links, replies, DMs, etc. Just plain and raw tweets. I think it's quite perfect. To have your Twitter stream on the side makes it subtle and non-disturbing. I don't like tabbing to a designated Twitter client/Twitter.com to check stuff. Now I can just throw a glance at the iPhone. It's universal and therefore works with the iPad, and I can only imagine how nice Trickle would look on a larger iPad display on your desk.</p>

          <p>That Tweetie for Mac is getting behind in the desktop Twitter clients for Mac race is a fact nowadays. Its UI is however phenomenal and I truly hope that Tweetie 2 will be released sometime soon. In the meantime, check out ReTweetie – a SIMBL plugin which adds Twitter's retweeting functionality to Tweetie. Great initiative ("if nobody do it, do it yourself").</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>37signals posted a job ad on their blog today, and they're looking for an interface designer. It's a superb post. It describes the position in detail – by reading it I know exactly what the position is all about, and what's expected from me. I get an insight in their work process and understand what they are looking for. But the most beautiful thing was near the bottom. Jason Fried put it: > It doesn’t matter where you went to school, or if you even graduated. It doesn’t matter if this is your first job or your fifth. Doing great work and being driven to improve yourself and everything you touch is what matters.
That's what's all about. When employers demand experience and/or education, they put up hinders for the applicant. Energy is drained on polishing (lying in) your resume (at least early in your career), and that energy could be used for doing work to put together a great portfolio instead. That paragraph made it totally clear to me.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Sigh. I wasn't happy with the last one. Overly complex and not straight to the point. So I sat down one evening, pretty casual, and I created something. I continued to experiment and in two days I had created a completely new look, and I liked it. This one features a more cleaner layout (responsive, of course) and clearer typography. I've put more attention to quickies I post and made some improvements to the HTML markup. But, the breaking news is the work page. I've finally put together something similar to a portfolio, although it's pretty humble. You're welcomed to have a look. For Swedish readers I've created a micro-site promoting me and my skills. It's in Swedish, but the design is pretty slick (the markup is sexy). Thanks for dropping by, and enjoy the new appearance. I hope I get some more motivation to write some more journal posts now ...</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Great piece by Milind Alvares about using older Apple hardware (in his case an iBook G4). I think it's a very interesting discussion: you don't always need the latest and greatest, even though Apple's products have that effect on you. Sometimes it's about a sentimental bond to an object (I had a hard time giving up my old iPhone 3G) and other times it's just not necessary to get a new one. The idea of using a "lesser" machine where I have constraints is quite thrilling, to be honest. It's a minimalist computer where I maybe can't runt all these fancy, heavy, Snow Leopard-y applications – instead I have to use simpler software and make the most of it. I know David Heinemeier Hansson said something similar, but I think that I work better with constraints. That's the reason I'm currently looking for an original iPod (preferably the one with touch wheel). Wouldn't it be nice to play plain, simple music without having a big-ass multitouch screen, cameras, Twitter apps and stuff on it? Give me a shout if you see one!</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Amnesty usually pulls off pretty cool campaigns in the public, and this one is not an exception. To raise awareness of Troy Davis, a man who has been on the death row for nineteen years and always pledged not guilty, the agency created a concept similar to those small cards you made when you were little. Thin stripes are attached to regular bars, and viewed from the right angle, Davis' face becomes visible. It makes the invisible visible.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>I think "Gimme Shelter" is a great song. It's sort of apocalyptic and majestic, and got that unique rhythm and a great lead guitar. But we're not even talking about Jagger and Merry Clayton's performances. God, especially the latter's when her voice cracks around 3:00 into the song. I've always been fascinated with the different parts of the song – the individual instruments. Now somebody has deconstructed "Gimme Shelter" – isolated the different studio tracks, i.e. the vocals, the bass, the drums, the guitars etc. It's really cool and interesting to see what makes a song. Below is the vocals and Keith Richards' rhythm guitar. Follow the link for more. Update: Are they kidding me? The clips are removed due to copyright infringement. So very bad.</p>
