          <p>The students that are successful look at that challenge, wrestle with feelings of inadequacy and stupidity, and begin to take steps hiking that mountain, knowing that bruised pride is a small price to pay for getting to see the view from the top. They ask for help, they acknowledge their inadequacies. They don't blame their lack of intelligence, they blame their lack of motivation.
Great text from an MIT grad about the challenges and feelings during his freshman year at MIT. Many wise quotes.</p>

          <p>Harry Roberts ("CSS Wizardry") wraps up the current state of measuring on the web, which I personally enjoyed reading about. I often dabble between doctrines when setting measures and sizes of type, margins, paddings, widths, etc. etc., and a concluding write-up was welcomed.</p>

          <p>CSS has long been the "language" of terror for more sophisticated developers. CSS can be messy, ugly, illogical, and utterly wonderful to work with sometimes. Recently, tools like SCSS and LESS have emerged which let us write more structured CSS in a DRY way (I've written about it before).</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Many sites on the web are good. They are well-designed, clear, have great information architecture and are easy to navigate. Often, web designers emphasize the "design" part too much, and neglect the other equally important things. However, there are sites which aren't that aesthetically pleasing, but still are the best sites in the world. They may look like a big, sad bag of wrestling underwear on the outside, but their underlying user experience is really, really refined, and thus makes the appearance part fade away while visiting the site. How and why?</p>

          <p>Great article on why PHP must go, and what the alternatives are – if there are any at all. PHP is a pretty neat language. It's available on almost every web host around the world. It's really easy for beginners to setup, write code, and publish it. Still, PHP is starting to become dreaded, unwanted and hated among serious new-era web developers. The familiar C style syntax is becoming old, there's a lot of noise in the code, and a lot more pet peeves which are forcing developers to other languages, such as Ruby, Python, and in recent days Javascript.</p>

          <p>Chrome 14 landed in the stable channel some days ago, and brings some better OS X Lion support, as well as a Web Audio API and "Native Client" (run C/C++ code in the browser). I also noticed a difference in the Web Inspector. I don't think this have been here in previous stable builds. In the Elements tab, to the right, two new buttons are added:</p>

          <p>Textmate has probably ruled the text editor universe for some years now. There are others; Coda, Espresso, BBEdit, Vim, Emacs, etc., but they don't cut it for me personally. But Textmate is getting old. The vast number of bundles for Textmate are for some people not enough arguments for sticking by an application which hasn't had a major update for several years.</p>
