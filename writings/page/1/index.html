        <div class="post-text">
          <p>The White Duck was, on the surface, lonely. She was not vicious, stupid, or bad in any way. She was just different from the rest of the ducks. It is not known whether it was the colour of her feathers, or lack thereof, who set her apart. Even though I am skeptical to that, it surely didn't strengthen her case.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>There is a thing that every developer has to do at some point â€“ ship. By ship I refer to the act of deploying, pushing the button, publishing your work for a wide mass. This act is central in our industry: blog posts like this one have been written, there have been talks on the subjects, and methodologies (like Continous Delivery, Continous Integration) invented to deal with the pain points associated with shipping. Hell, there are even roles (devops, sysops) for easening the burden of moving code from one system to another. Why, oh why are we conscious and sometimes afraid of shipping our work?</p>

          <p>When working with building features in a product, I usually need some emotional attachment to them.
