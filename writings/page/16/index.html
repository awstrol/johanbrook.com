        </header>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>As of the release of Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 3, the version of Java that is ported by Apple, and that ships with Mac OS X, is deprecated. This means that the Apple-produced runtime will not be maintained at the same level, and may be removed from future versions of Mac OS X. The Java runtime shipping in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, and Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, will continue to be supported and maintained through the standard support cycles of those products.
Was just a matter of time, if you ask me.</p>

          <p>Just for fun, Louie Mantia (Iconfactory, now Apple), has redesigned some of Beatles' album covers. They are really slick, every one of them. I especially like the "Let It Be" and "With The Beatles" versions.</p>

          <p>If someone claims to have the perfect programming language, he is either a fool or a salesman or both
In 1985 Bjarne Stroustrup created the C++ programming language, much because of his and his colleague's frustration with C. Today C++ is everywhere and is in my opinion the mainstream and "godfather language" for beginners to get accustomed with. I remember my excitement and interest when I got a "Learn To Program C++ in 24 Hours" book for Christmas once. Then picture my excitement when I, Johan, wrote – created – my first usable program (a Celsius-Fahrenheit converter). Long live C++.</p>

          <p>I've really got a thing for clean typographic blogs with seemingly custom illustrations in them. Above is a great collection of vintage woodcuts and engravings, scanned and released for public use. That is, you can download them and use completely free in both personal and commercial projects.

        </header>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Notational Velocity is a simple yet powerful writing app for OS X. It's focusing on speed and just bare-bone note taking – with no frills. I've fallen in love with the app, since it also supports syncing with Simplenote. It's the perfect triquetra: I've got my notes in the cloud, on my iPhone and in my Mac. Notational Velocity also saves the notes as plain text files on the hard drive – another layer of backup. The application doesn't look that bad, but it's no slick Apple Design Award stuff either. The unofficial release above, the fork, includes some changes to the layout. It brings an iPad like interface, with all notes to the left of the writing area instead of above. That could give more of an overview of all notes (I think it's better since computer screens today of course are more wide than tall). Other tweaks include full screen mode and a way to hide the notes list. On of the best features of the fork is the option to hide the dock icon all together and use a menu bar icon instead. That's really slick. I believe that a note taking app like Notational Velocity should be "in the background", and not some designated app you switch to. You drop in – write the note – and drop out. That's the reason for my affection for the post it notes in Dashboard. I press one keyboard shortcut and I'm in taking notes. So go ahead and download the fork from the link above and use it as the regular Notational Velocity. However, I don't like the default dock icon for the app, so here's a zip with a slick moleskine icon.</p>
