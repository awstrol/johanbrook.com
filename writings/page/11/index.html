        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Developer Steve Streza shows us the Twitter client for iOS he's been building for the last two years (!), but now announces dead. It's got quite an innovative UI, and mind he began working on it before the real flood of Twitter clients for iPhone came along, and maybe most important: before Tweetie for iPhone became Twitter for iPhone. Streamlines does not only show you your Twitter stream: you're able to incorporate Facebook friends as well, and even merge them together into one. The UI sounds really interesting as Streza chose to avoid the common tab bars and instead use a "card interface with a horizontal swipe, similar to the iPhone's Weather app or WebOS' multitasking UI".</p>

          <p>IDEs are not my kind of idea of how software should be developed. If your programming language, toolkit or library is so extensive and complicated that you need an IDE to develop, something is wrong. Small is beautiful. A plain old text editor is enough to make the world’s most amazing web applications.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Maven Pro is a free sans serif font designed by Joe Prince. It currently consists of a single weight, but the creators promises more to come. I think it looks incredibly slick and fine tuned. You're free to donate: all proceeds go to charity. (However, the site doesn't say wether the font is okay to use in web design as a @font-face__) Update: After reading the ReadMe it clearly states it's okay to embed the font with @font-face: > This font CAN be used with @font-face and the web font files are included, enjoy!
EOT, SVG, WOFF and TTF are included, as well as the regular OTF font file. Awesomeness.</p>

          <p>Say you have a paragraph with the CSS of color: red; . If you would want to add a border in the same color you would just have to type border: 1px solid; . The border-color inherits from the paragraphs color property. How about using your element's color value for other things than border-colors? A neat CSS keyword I didn't know about makes this possible: currentcolor . Treat it as any other color keyword (like red, blue, green etc.) and wherever it's used, the color of the color is used.</p>

          <p>37signals usually do things right, and customer service is not an exception. In December customers of their real-time chat application, Campfire, experienced downtimes and overall unstable behavior. Not being able to access web applications sucks, and especially if you're a paying customer and your daily business life depends on it. But shit happens, right? This can happen to the best (customers of Apple's MobileMe weren't that happy in the initial shaky stages). What's dead important and actually good act in your favor is how you handle the crisis. In the linked article Jason Fried tells us a little bit about how they communicated with their customers during the downtime. They used real words for this real problem, not corporate talk. They wrote a blog post explaining exactly what had happened and what measures they took to make sure it wouldn't happen again. As the title of the article says, they turned this negative event to further show their customers how much they care.</p>

          <p>Rasmus Andersson who's currently developing the code editor Kod is telling us a little bit about how he came up with the idea, and why. I really like the spirit and goals of the project. The upcoming syntax highlighting and plugin features appeals a lot to me, as well as the clever address field in the app, which lets you edit any text file you know the URL for – local or remote. Textmate is great, but it's not that maintained and up-to-date. A lightweight, customizable, community developed code editor like Kod would help a lot. Go check out Kod's Github page and see if there's anything you can do.</p>

          <p>Tab Atkins of Google has made a couple of slides (navigate with the arrow keys) explaining a couple of possible upcoming features to Webkit: CSS variables, mixin blocks and selector nesting. That's pretty huge, given that people have been screaming for those features for years and years. Hell, a couple of smart guys even wrote scripts to compile (yeah, compile) their own form of CSS syntax to regular CSS ( Sass and Less).</p>

          <p>Frank Chimero shares a quite cool idea about how to get an overview of your income as a freelancer, which could help you realize you actually can say no to certain projects. I really think the visual is most important – when you have it written on a huge whiteboard you see it from another perspective. It becomes sort of a way of restraining yourself from getting too money-hungry and accept boring jobs. Go read the post, it's a bright idea.</p>
