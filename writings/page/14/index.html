          <p>But the ugly truth is that the average Joe Client simply doesn’t care. Joe is looking not for a compliant website, but for an effective website.
Good post on why web designers shouldn't get too excited about their beloved web standards and semantics. Clients want great looking web sites that accomplish their goals. We should however use standards in order to achieve that – a well written, compatible, usable, accessible, future-proof web site. The post brings up exactly that: how we need to explain to the client how the underlying code and the designer's excessive relationship to semantics can help the client and in the end save more money (which is almost always the single biggest factor).</p>

          <p>This is my moka pot. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My moka pot is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my moka pot is useless. Without my moka pot, I am useless. I must maintain my moka pot thoroughly. I must grind better than the epsresso machine, who is trying to put us down. I must brew before he brews me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my moka pot and myself are defenders of the love for coffee, we are the masters of espresso, we are the saviors of my tastebuds. So be it, until there is no tea, but coffee. Amen.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Google can’t reduce scope like Instagram did. Instagram started out as being a far different product than actually shipped [...] It actually started out as a service that did a lot more than just photographs. But, they learned they couldn’t complete such a grand vision and do it well. So they kept throwing out features. Instagram can do that.
Robert Scoble on why it would be difficult for a Google team to built a product like Instagram. It's all about simplicity.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Gruber just posted a link to an interview of Ryan Singer from 37signals, where Singer mentioned a mobile HTML5 framework. That's pretty big stuff – Ruby on Rails is doing pretty good, and a mobile framework in the same style would be quite awesome, since it according to Singer uses Coffeescript – a way more human friendly, Ruby like style of writing Javascript (a programmer friend of mine is totally in love with it). We've got a lot of Javascript frameworks for mobile devices these days. The first one I got in touch with (no pun intended, promise) was jQTouch – a simple and stylish jQuery framework mainly for iOS. That one evolved into Sencha Touch (now based on Ext.js), and the jQuery group themselves recently released jQuery Mobile with support for a lot of phones and operating systems. Two more heavy-weight guys are Sproutcore and Cappuccino. Isn't the market over-saturated soon? Will this mobile framework by 37signals become just one in a million, or might it be "the one"? Before everybody go nuts, it's worth noting that Sam Stephenson (37signals, creator of Prototype.js) stated this in a comment on the interview:</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Skype 5 Beta for Mac arrived earlier today. I like the unified one-window concept and group video calls. But I and almost the rest of my Twitter stream think there's too much whitespace in certain areas, the instant messaging chat, for example. The thing is, the messaging area uses Webkit and therefore CSS to style the messages. You can change style by going to the Skype preferences > Messaging > Style. Custom styles live in ~/Library/Application Support/Skype/ChatStyles , and are in the .SkypeChatStyle format (basically a package consisting of CSS, HTML and JS files). To the point of this post: Andy Graulund has created a minimal style for Skype 5 beta, Panamerica Mini. Download and put in the folder I mentioned above, and chose the style from the Preferences.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
          <p>Tower is an upcoming Mac client for the Git versioning system, and it looks good. I'm still a noob on Git, so I guess I would find it very useful, and maybe even power users in large projects would too. Anyhow I think it's great that it exists a native client for Mac – like Sequel Pro for MySQL databases. Choice is good. The command line doesn't always cut it, and web based is ... yeah, web based. It doesn't say if it's paid or free, but the developers are on Twitter ( @gittower), and Tower is coming this November.</p>

          <p>This is kind of a long read, but definitely Instapaper material. It's a transcript from Keith's speech from the Fronteers conference 2010. If you're going to read just a couple of pieces about HTML5, make sure you get this one. He brings up history of HTML and XHTML – a story about agony, betrayal and markup. He talks about the simplicity in HTML5 (the doctype!) and how we can solve the common problems we had in XHTML 1.0 with the new spec. If you're into details and nitty-gritty stuff like I am, go read this.</p>
