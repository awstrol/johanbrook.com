**This page** reflects what I'm doing with my life at the moment. No pressure here, Johanâ€¦

I have the privilege of traveling while working remotely (doing this nomad thing). My current travel plans are:

1. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ~~**Madrid**~~, Spain (January)
2. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¾ ~~**AsunciÃ³n**~~, Paraguay (February-April, *if El NiÃ±o doesn't fuck the country over again*)
3. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ~~**San Diego**~~, U.S. (March)
4. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· **Rio de Janeiro**, Brazil (April-late May). View some [photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/riosexton/) from me and my friends.
5. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª **Gothenburg**, Sweden (May-September)
6. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **New York**, U.S. Preliminary (September)

I spend my time on these things:

- working in [Lookback](http://lookback.io) as web app developer and designer. Mostly doing product and writing Javascript in [Meteor](http://meteor.com).
- reading books and articles, in order to get my mind off the digital things. Ironically, I mostly read articles on product design, code, and startups.
- I'm currently reading *A Moveable Feast* by Hemingway. Previously, I read *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* by Robert Hirsig.
- meeting new people in the cities I visit, as well as connecting with existing ones.
- trying to come up with a nice side project. I think I'm on to something, and it involves [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org).
- photo snapping and travel memories collecting on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/johanbrook/).
- playing the guitar. I usually play music by the Swedish artist HÃ¥kan HellstrÃ¶m.
- learning Portuguese on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/johanbrook).
- writing [open source packages for Meteor](https://atmospherejs.com/lookback/).
- trying to write more articles on this site.

If my life changes, I'll update this page.
